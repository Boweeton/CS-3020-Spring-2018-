C# HW 1 Preproduction: 

Initialize New Game:
// 

Game Loop:
// User makes a shot

// The Game object runs through each boat to see if they own that cell
	// If the guessed cell is owned by a boat, adjust the corresponding cell accordingly
		// If the boat is fully destroyed, flip the boolean and inform the user
	// If the guessed cell isn't owned by a boat, adjust the corresponding cell accordingly

// Update the visuals
	// (do the code)

// Request new shot
	// Ask for the letter/number combo
		// Strip off bookending spaces
			// Split into array by space and remove empty elements (one call)
				// If there is exactly one element, check to see if it has exactly 2 chars
				// If there are exactly two elements, check to see if they're both 1 char long
				// Else REJECT ENTRY
			// Check to see if they're valid coordinates (letter THEN number)
				// If yes, user has made shot!
				// If no, REJECT ENTRY
	// If REJECT ENTRY, clear console and inform the user that the attempt was bad... then ask again
